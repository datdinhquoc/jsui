# JSUI (JSD for UI)
JavaScript for UI Web Transfer Protocol

JSUI is exactly the same as Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol with headers, etc. but the content is in JSD instead of HTML.

* Web: Web means a network of computer or Internet, web doesn't mean HTTP
* JSUI: This project tries to launch a new protocol for browsers that parse JSD for UI and show up just like HTML.
    * Example: `jsui://somedomain.ext` instead of `http://somedomain.ext`
    * Why JSUI (JSD for UI)? It's a neat, simple, and smart markup language based on JavaScript and is fully convertible to HTML.
